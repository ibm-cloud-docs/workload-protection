# Linking a policy to a zone
{: #posture-link-policy-to-zone}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}} Posture Policies to manage policies in your environment.
{: shortdesc}

A new policy is not associated with a zone when the policy is created.

Policies without a linked zone have a "Missing Zone" indicator.
{: note}

To apply a policy to a zone, complete the following steps:

1. Hover over the **Policies** icon ![Policies icon](/images/policies.png "Policies") and click **Policies** in the *Posture* section.

2. Link the policy to a zone.

   * If the zone exists, add the policy by using the [Zones configuration page.](/docs/workload-protection?topic=workload-protection-posture-zones)

   * If the zone does not exist, [create and configure the zone,](/docs/workload-protection?topic=workload-protection-posture-zones).
