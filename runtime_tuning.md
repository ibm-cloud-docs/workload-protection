# Runtime policy tuning
{: #runtime_tuning}

The runtime policy tuning feature helps reduce false positive inicators in the {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}} events feed. Built on the Falco Rules Tuner, it automatically adds exceptions to rules, and removes noisy sets of policy events while lower-volume events are retained for later analysis.
